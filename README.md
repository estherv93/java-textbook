# java-textbook

## August 8, 2016

This fall, I am working through "Starting Out with Java", Gaddis and Muganda.
I will upload any files associated with this textbook, including quizzes, questions, etc.

## Update: August 15, 2016

I have just finished reading Chapter 4 and am working on some questions that Elijah sent me, located in the Additional HW folder. 
My goal is to finish the 8 chapters by Friday. I'll check back then to see how things went. 

## Update: August 31, 2016

So I finished Chapter 8 on Tuesday, Aug 23. A few days later than I expected, but it's been completed. I celebrated the end of the textbook readings by going to see _Kubo and the Two Strings_ in the theater. It was good. 

Upon further discussion with Elijah, I have a new timeline for study. First, we will complete the Udemy Devslopes Course by Sep 12. That week, before he leaves to Iceland, we will discuss the project scope, etc., like we did for the Chore App. On the following week, we will start to dig into creating the app. I will check in on the 12th to see how things are going.
