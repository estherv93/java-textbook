# java-textbook

August 8, 2016 - 
This fall, I am working through "Starting Out with Java", Gaddis and Muganda.
I will upload any files associated with this textbook, including quizzes, questions, etc.

Update: August 15, 2016 - 
I have just finished reading Chapter 4 and am working on some questions that Elijah sent me, located in the Additional HW folder. 
My goal is to finish the 8 chapters by Friday. I'll check back then to see how things went.
